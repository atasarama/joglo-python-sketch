# 🏡 Joglo Sketch using Python Turtle

This is my first Python project, created during a volunteer cultural exchange workshop with Korean students from **Jeju National University** under **WFK (World Friends Korea)** in August 2023.

I used the `turtle` module to draw a traditional Javanese house — **Joglo** — as a way to introduce Indonesian culture through code. This project was voted as the best by the class.
